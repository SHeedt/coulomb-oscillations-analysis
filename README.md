# coulomb-oscillations-analysis
Fitting routine for analyzing Coulomb blockade oscillations.
The Jupyter notebook is an example of fitting Coulomb peaks with a thermally-broadened Breit-Wigner line shape.
coulomb_oscillations_analysis.py has been written by Bernard van Heck and is used here for initial peak finding.
