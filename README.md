# coulomb-oscillations-analysis
Fitting routine for analyzing Coulomb blockade oscillations.<br />
The Jupyter notebook is an example for fitting Coulomb peaks with a thermally-broadened Breit-Wigner line shape.<br />
coulomb_oscillations_analysis.py has been written by Bernard van Heck (https://github.com/bernardvanheck/cb_data_analysis) and is used here for initial peak finding.
